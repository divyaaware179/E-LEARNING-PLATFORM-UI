DESCRIPTION- 
Project Title: E-LEARNING-PLATFORM-UI

The aim of this project is to design and develop the front-end interface of an interactive and visually appealing e-learning platform. This platform is intended to serve as a learning portal where users can browse various courses, track their progress, and view educational video content. The deliverable is a styled, multi-page, and interactive front-end application built using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This front-end project includes the creation of multiple HTML pages representing the different sections of the platform: a homepage, course listing, course details, video learning page, and a user dashboard. Each page is styled using CSS to ensure visual consistency, modern layout design, and responsiveness across devices. Basic JavaScript is used to enable interactivity, such as marking course modules as complete or showing progress bars.

The homepage (index.html) acts as the landing page for users. It features a welcoming header, navigation menu, and a brief introduction to the platform’s purpose — offering online courses to improve users' skills. This page sets the tone for the user experience with a violet-themed background and a clean layout.

The courses page (courses.html) lists available courses in a card-style layout. Each course card contains an image thumbnail, course title, and a link to view more details. This is useful for browsing and selecting desired courses. The design allows future scalability for filters and search features.

Clicking a course takes the user to the course detail page (course.html). Here, users can find a course description, list of modules, and a preview video embedded from YouTube. The embedded video is used to provide real-life visual content, enhancing the learning experience. The YouTube video link is customizable and can be tailored for each course based on topic relevance. The course detail page also includes a call-to-action button to start learning.

The video learning page (video.html) is where the actual instruction happens. It includes a full-width embedded video player along with a “Mark as Complete” button implemented using JavaScript. This simulates progress tracking and improves engagement by letting users feel a sense of accomplishment as they complete modules.

The user dashboard (dashboard.html) is a personal interface showing enrolled courses and a visual progress bar indicating how much of a course has been completed. This visual feedback encourages continued learning. The progress bar is styled using CSS and dynamically filled based on course status.

All styling is done through a single style.css file that applies a consistent violet-themed aesthetic throughout the platform. Key components such as headers, navigation bars, buttons, and cards follow a consistent color scheme, improving usability and branding. The violet color theme creates a calm and creative atmosphere suitable for education platforms.

Finally, interactivity is added using a simple script.js file. Features like marking modules complete and triggering alerts are handled here.

This project is entirely front-end based, meaning it can be opened directly in a browser without the need for a backend or database. It is a perfect example of how an educational user interface can be structured using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
